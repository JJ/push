I’m announcing the soft launch of *Push* today. I don’t even know what “soft launch” is supposed to
mean. For me and for *Push*, it means that the bulk of the journal is in place enough to invite
others to start working on it.

I have no confidence that this project will succeed, but in success or in failure, it will be an
attempt at something new. In the coming days, I will be posting lots more about the genesis of
*Push* and the technology and design decisions I made for this initial iteration.

There are still plenty of problems to solve (actually, I don’t see much of anything but problems
right now), but that’s the cool thing about an iterative process that Git makes clear over time. As
soon as I commit this post, I’ll be up to 111 commits since I started the real work on the project
back on October 13, beginning with a
[sad little README.md file](https://github.com/cwcon/push/commit/16c498557ea3831c585e2a35557a67727dc6e6f3).

But I don’t want to keep working alone on this. Please have a look at everything, including and
especially [how you can contribute](/contribute/) to *Push*.
