<p>The sections below review the basic steps for creating article submissions, blog posts, and features/fixes for <em>Push</em> itself.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Git, you might want to have a read through the full <a href='/learn/'>Learn</a> area on the <em>Push</em> site. Additionally, there is more help to be found in the <a href='http://git-scm.com/book'>Git Community Book</a>. For an excellent and thorough treatment of Git, purchase Travis Swicegood’s <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git'>Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</a></p>

<h2 id='article_submission'>Article Submission</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To prepare a submission for <em>Push</em>, run</p>

<pre><code> $ git checkout -b submission</code></pre>

<p>which creates and checks out a branch called <code>submission</code>. (Note: you can use other branch names, but make sure that whatever you choose would make sense to yourself, and others.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Then, change directories into <code>submissions</code> and make a copy of the <code>_starter.md</code> file, using the pattern <code>lastname-submission-title.md</code>. We’ll pretend for this example that Lesley Smith is preparing a submission called “HTML is the Best”:</p>

<pre><code> $ cd submissions
 $ cp _starter.md smith-html-is-the-best.md</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now’s a good time to add that file and commit it to Git:</p>

<pre><code> $ git add smith-html-is-the-best.md
 $ git commit -m &quot;Starting my submission, HTML is the Best&quot;</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Open your file in your editor of choice, and start writing. As you reach what seem to be significant milestones in your writing, be sure to add and commit the file to Git as above.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To make sure that your work is backed up off of your computer and available for you to clone onto other computers, be sure to periodically run:</p>

<pre><code> $ git push origin submission</code></pre>

<p>which will push your <code>submission</code> branch to a <code>submission</code> branch on your fork of <em>Push</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once your submission is ready for review, submit a pull request by hitting the Pull Request button on GitHub on your fork of the <em>Push</em> repository. Make sure you choose the correct branch with your submission work from your repository when submitting your request.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Need more help? <a href='/learn/'>read through the <em>Push</em> Learn area</a> and <a href='//learn/style-guide.html'>style guide</a> for additional information and guidance. And if you need a question answered, just <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new'>open an Issue on the <em>Push</em> repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id='blog_submission'>Blog Submission</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To prepare a blog submission for <em>Push</em>, run</p>

<pre><code> $ git checkout -b blogpost</code></pre>

<p>which creates and checks out a branch called <code>blogpost</code>. (Note: you can use other branch names, but make sure that whatever you choose would make sense to yourself, and others.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Then, change directories into <code>_posts</code> and make a copy of the <code>_starter.md</code> file, using the pattern <code>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</code>. We’ll pretend for this example that Lesley Smith is preparing a blog post called “New CSS3 Styles” on November 1, 2012:</p>

<pre><code> $ cd _posts
 $ cp _starter.md 2012-11-01-new-css3-styles.md</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now’s a good time to add that file and commit it to Git:</p>

<pre><code> $ git add 2012-11-01-new-css3-styles.md
 $ git commit -m &quot;Starting my blog post, New CSS3 Styles&quot;</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Open your file in your editor of choice, and start writing. As you reach what seem to be significant milestones in your writing, be sure to add and commit the file to Git as above. For example, filling out the YAML front matter at the top of the file is a milestone worth commiting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To make sure that your work is backed up off of your computer and available for you to clone onto other computers, be sure to periodically run:</p>

<pre><code> $ git push origin blogpost</code></pre>

<p>which will push your <code>blogpost</code> branch to a <code>blogpost</code> branch on your fork of <em>Push</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once your submission is ready for review, submit a pull request by hitting the Pull Request button on GitHub on your fork of the <em>Push</em> repository. Make sure you choose the correct branch with your submission work from your repository when submitting your request.</p>
</li>

<h2 id='features_and_fixes'>Features and Fixes</h2>

<p>Features and fixes for <em>Push</em> should be kept on separate, topical branches. In this case, we’ll pretend someone is on a typo-fixing rampage. All of the fixes, in other words, are catching typos. No major content rewrites, or CSS style fixes, or anything like that (each of those would get their own feature branch).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To prepare a topical branch for typos, run:</p>

<pre><code> $ git checkout -b typos</code></pre>

<p>which creates and checks out a branch called <code>typos</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Open the problem file or files in your editor of choice, and start fixing. As you reach what seem to be significant milestones in your work, be sure to add and commit the files to Git.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To make sure that your work is backed up off of your computer and available for you to clone onto other computers, be sure to periodically run:</p>

<pre><code> $ git push origin typos</code></pre>

<p>which will push your <code>typos</code> branch to a <code>typos</code> branch on your fork of <em>Push</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once your feature/fix is ready for review, submit a pull request by hitting the Pull Request button on GitHub on your fork of the <em>Push</em> repository. Make sure you choose the correct branch with your submission work from your repository when submitting your request.</p>
