# Submit your work

You can push to your own copy of *Push* as often as you need to; once you’re ready to have your
submission or fix reviewed, you’ll need to open a pull request on GitHub.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### On GitHub
*You’ll do this each time you make a new submission to* Push *.*

1. Navigate to your copy of *Push* in your GitHub account; switch to your submission branch using
   the branch pulldown menu on GitHub.

2. Click the ‘Pull Request’ button at the top of the page. That will open up a new screen. At the
   lefthand side, GitHub should have chosen `cwcon/push` as the base repository, and `master` as the
   base branch. On the righthand side, you should see your repository listed as the head repository,
   and your submission branch as the head branch.

3. In the box below, you’ll see the name of your most recent commit; if that is not descriptive of
   the changes you’re submitting, adjust the title (or consider
   [squashing your commits](/learn/squashing-commits.html) before you start your pull request). Then
   provide a fuller description of your submission or changes in the larger text box.

4. Hit the ‘Send pull request’ button, and sit tight and wait for feedback.

## Next Steps

Now comes the waiting part, while other *Push* contributors review your work and offer you comments.
Eventually, you almost certainly have to make revisions.
[Fortunately, Git is made for revision](/learn/revise-and-push.html).
