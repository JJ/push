    <h1 id='write_in_yaml_and_markdown'>Write in YAML and Markdown</h1>

<p>Rather than writing directly in HTML, you can write article and blog submissions in two arguably simpler languages: <a href='http://www.yaml.org/'>YAML</a>, which stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” and is used for metadata at the top of a file that is otherwise written in <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview'>Markdown</a>, a basic set of plain-text formatting conventions that are converted to the HTML see on the <em>Push</em> site.</p>

<h2 id='stepbystep_instructions'>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Both <em>Push</em> submissions and <em>Push</em> blog posts are begun from starter files called <code>_starter.md</code>, found in either <code>submissions/</code> or <code>_posts/</code>. Because the starter file for blog posts is simpler, it will be the example considered here. But know that the submission starter file works the same way; it just asks for additional information.</p>

<p>So, have a look at the contents of the <code>_posts/_starter.md</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: Post Title Here
author: Author Name Here
author_bio: &gt;
            Bio here. Markdown is allowed. Break onto new lines if necessary.
layout: post
---

And start writing your post here, in Markdown. See the style guide at
http://push.cwcon.org//learn/style-guide.html</code></pre>

<p>The top portion of the file, between the two sets of three hyphens (<code>---</code>), is known as YAML, which stands for <a href='http://www.yaml.org/'>YAML Ain’t Markup Language</a>. It probably doesn’t even look like computer language, really. All YAML consists of is some name for a piece of information (<code>title</code>, <code>author</code>), followed by a colon, and then the information itself.</p>

<p>The only piece that looks unusual is the <code>author_bio: &gt;</code> line; the angle bracket (<code>&gt;</code>) just allows for longer, multi-line pieces of text, such as an author’s biography. The important thing is to begin the text following a <code>&gt;</code> on an indented new line of text, and to keep the lines indented uniformly.</p>

<p><em>You’ll do this each time you start a new article for submission or blog post.</em></p>

<h4 id='writing_the_yaml_frontmatter'>Writing the YAML Frontmatter</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog Posts</strong>: Rather than editing the <code>_starter.md</code> files directly, make a copy of them for your submission or blog post. Blog post files should start with the date in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format (use the current date when you begin your post; the file name will be changed to the current date upon posting), followed by the post’s title separated by hyphens. Here’s the procedure for a post called “My Test Post” created on December 3, 2012:</p>

<pre><code> $ cd ~/Projects/push
 $ cp _posts/_starter.md _posts/2012-12-03-my-test-post.md</code></pre>

<p><strong>Article Submissions</strong>: For article submissions, create a file with your last name (and the last names of your co-authors, if you’re co-authoring) and the article title. Here is how Jim Jenkins would prepare his file for an article titled “This Article Changes Everything”:</p>

<pre><code> $ cp submissions/_starter.md submissions/jenkins-this-article-changes-everything.md</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can now open the file for editing in your text editor. If you have command-line tools installed for opening files in your editor (like the <code>edit</code> command for TextWrangler), you can use them here:</p>

<pre><code> $ edit _posts/2012-12-13-my-test-post.md</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, use your text editor to find and open the file in your <code>push</code> folder inside of <code>Projects</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There’s no magic to writing YAML. The only catch is to make sure that you always leave a space after the colon for every value. The YAML for Johnny Q. Blogger’s “My Test Post” file might look like something like this:</p>

<pre><code> ---
 title: My Test Post
 author: Johnny Q. Blogger
 author_bio: &gt;
             I blog about things, and my middle
             inital is Q. You’ll never guess
             what the ‘Q’ stands for. Trust me.
 layout: post
 ---

 And start writing your post here, in Markdown. See the style guide at
 http://push.cwcon.org//learn/style-guide.html</code></pre>

<p>Pretty basic; leave the <code>layout: </code> value set to <code>post</code>. And be sure that the lines of your biography are indented uniformly, as Johnny Q. Blogger has done.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>At this point, you would probably want to make a commit to your Git repository, but <a href='/learn/add-and-commit.html'>that’s covered in another section</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='writing_content_in_markdown'>Writing Content in Markdown</h4>

<p>The remainder of the file, following the second set of three hyphens, is all <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax'>Markdown</a>. If you’ve ever used a wiki, Markdown is somewhat like a wiki’s formatting syntax.</p>

<p>Paragraphs are just created by two empty lines of white space (not unlike how you do a paragraph in an email). Headings, lists, and other features have their own syntax. You can read all about the preferred styles for <em>Push</em> in the <a href='//learn/style-guide.html'>style guide</a>&#8211;which you may want to cross reference with <a href='https://raw.github.com/cwcon/push/master/style-guide.md'>its raw Markdown source</a>.</p>

<h2 id='next_steps'>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Once you begin writing your article submission or blog post for <em>Push</em>, you’ll probably want to see how it will appear, so it’s time to learn <a href='/learn/previewing-work.html'>how to preview your work in your Web browser</a>.</p>
