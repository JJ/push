# Revise your contribution

To revise your fix or submission to *Push*, you basically do what you’ve been doing: make changes,
add and commit, and push to your copy of *Push*. Your pull request to the main *Push* repository
will update accordingly; but below are ways to address a specific reviewer’s comments.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### On GitHub

Watch the comments that will appear under your pull request. As you receive suggestions, you can
discuss them further with the reviewers on GitHub.

### On Your Computer
*You’ll do this each time you make revisions to your work.*

Keep things easy for reviewers, and work on one reviewer’s feedback at a time--or if multiple
reviewers have feedback on a similar issue, work on the issue. If you can, keep your work to address
that issue as a single commit (or squash them into one); and when you commit, be sure to mention the
GitHub usernames of reviewers whose feedback the commit addresses.

Note that commits will show up as part of the discussion on your pull request.

## Next Steps

You’ve now covered all of the essential steps for making contributions to *Push*. Here are some
additional, advanced topics that you can learn to impress your friends (or at least to solve some
problems that sometimes creep up when using Git):

* **[Change File Names in Git](/learn/change-file-names.html)**: Did you change your article or blog
  post title after you started writing? Do you want to update the date on your blog post files?
  There’s a special way to do that in Git.

* **[Keep Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/learn/stay-updated.html)**: Once you make a copy of *Push*,
  you have to keep it up to date. And you’ll want to start new submissions based on the most
  up-to-date version of *Push*.

* **[Pretend You Kept Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/learn/git-rebase.html)**: Work on *Push* is
  distributed and ongoing. Make your contribution appear to be based on the very latest version of
  *Push*.

* **[Fix Common Git Goofs](/learn/fixing-git-goofs.html)**: Added a file that’s not ready to be
  committed? Committed a file that you shouldn’t have? Want to just start over from an earlier point
  in your work’s history? No problem.

* **[Submit as One Commit](/learn/squashing-commits.html)**: Keep reviewers’ lives easier. Let Git
  help you submit a single, seamless commit containing your changes.

* **[Collaborate with Others](/learn/multiple-remotes.html)**: Sometimes a comment on GitHub isn’t
  enough. Sometimes you want to write an article collaboratively. Learn how to collaborate like a
  pro.
