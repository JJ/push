<p><em>Push</em> aims to set a new standard for openness.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Access</strong>: <em>Push</em>’s content is freely available and liberally licensed. That’s nothing new in the world of open access publishing.</p>

<p>But by hosting <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/'>all of <em>Push</em>’s source code</a> on GitHub, there are no secrets, nothing that isn’t subject to public scrutiny and review–and improvement. Comment on <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/commits/master/'>commits</a>. <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues'>Open a new issue</a> to spark discussion. <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork'>Fork the codebase</a>, and then <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/pulls'>submit a pull request</a> with your contribution for discussion, refinement, and ultimately inclusion in the journal’s codebase.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open Review</strong>: Publications in established areas of inquiry can rely on double-blind peer review (usually by only a couple of people, at the discretion of an editor) to accomplish their gate-keeping function.</p>

<p><em>Push</em> is not just a gate-keeper; in addition to reviewing research, contributors to the journal will to explicitly and directly help develop the work of others prior to publication. Anyone who wishes to <a href='/contribute/'>contribute</a> to <em>Push</em> should be as invested in producing a quality publication with quality articles as much as they are invested in helping develop researchers who submit their work.</p>

<p>Research into source code as part of the written rhetorical act represents a very new area of inquiry, with few established experts. <em>Push</em> aims to identify and develop those experts through a scholarly venue dedicated to writing &amp; source.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open, Distributed Archiving</strong>: To submit or otherwise contribute to <em>Push</em>, you have to <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork'>fork its repository</a>, and then pull down your forked copy to your own computer. Each time you do that, you make a complete copy of the journal. You particpate in its archiving as well as its improvement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open Communication</strong>: <em>Push</em> will not use any communication channels that are not publically available and open. No secret communiques. No backchannel. All communication regarding the journal’s development, the review of blog posts and articles, and changes to the fundamental structure of the journal itself will take place on GitHub.</p>
