# People

Right now, this page is pretty empty. But your name belongs here, if you’re willing to help out.
Want in? [Contribute to Push](/contribute/). First time you submit a pull request, be sure to add
your name to the contributors list below.

And right now, everyone’s a contributor. No editors, no advisory-board members who did something
great elsewhere who mysteriously get to be listed as having done something here. You either
contribute, or you don’t. Titles will be earned, not granted, as decided by other *Push*
contributors.
