    <h1 id='about_push'>About Push</h1>

<p><em>Push</em> is an experiment on its way to becoming an academic journal on the research &amp; applied theory of source-level digital writing.</p>

<h2 id='a_meritocracy'>A Meritocracy</h2>

<p><em>Push</em> has <a href='/about/people.html'>a staff</a> of exactly one person at this point. But nobody gets appointed to any title or rank. Unlike the academic tradition of seeking endorsement from big-name scholars, <em>Push</em> is going to operate like any other open-source project. Want a spot on the board? An editorship? You can only earn it by <a href='/contribute/'>contributing</a> to the journal.</p>

<h2 id='radical_openness'>Radical Openness</h2>

<p><em>Push</em> is attempting to achieve a new landmark in openness and open-access publishing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Access</strong>: <em>Push</em>’s content is freely available and liberally licensed. That’s nothing new in the world of open-access publishing.</p>

<p>But by hosting <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/'>all of <em>Push</em>’s source code</a> on GitHub, there are no secrets, nothing that isn’t subject to public scrutiny and review–and improvement. Comment on <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/commits/master/'>commits</a>. <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues'>Open a new issue</a> to spark discussion. <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork'>Fork the codebase</a>, and then <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/pulls'>submit a pull request</a> with your contribution for discussion, refinement, and ultimately inclusion in the journal’s codebase.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open Review</strong>: Publications in established areas of inquiry can rely on double-blind peer review (usually by only a couple of people, at the discretion of an editor) to accomplish their gate-keeping function.</p>

<p><em>Push</em> is not just a gate-keeper; in addition to reviewing research, contributors to the journal should commit to helping develop the work of others prior to publication. <em>Push</em> needs <a href='/contribute/'>contributors</a> who will invest equally in producing a quality publication with quality articles as well as in helping develop researchers who submit their work for review.</p>

<p>Research into source code as part of the written rhetorical act represents a new area of inquiry, with few established experts. <em>Push</em> aims to identify and develop those experts through a scholarly venue dedicated to source-level writing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open, Distributed Archiving</strong>: To submit or otherwise contribute to <em>Push</em>, you have to <a href='https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork'>fork its repository</a>, and then pull down your forked copy to your own computer. Each time you do that, you make a complete copy of the journal. You particpate in its archiving as well as its improvement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Open Communication</strong>: <em>Push</em> will not use any communication channels that are not publically available and open. No secret communiques. No backchannel. All communication regarding the journal’s development, the review of blog posts and articles, and changes to the fundamental structure of the journal itself will take place on GitHub.</p>
