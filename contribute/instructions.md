# How to write and submit an article for *Push*

1. Fork [the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push) on GitHub and clone
   it to your computer.
1. Make a copy of the article starter file, `_starter.md`, and name it
  `yourname-submission-title.md` (with your name and actual submission title, of course).
1. Fill in the information at the top of the file, and write up your work in Markdown.
1. Track your progress with frequent Git commits.
1. Keep your article under 2500 words or so, cite in footnotes according to the Chicago Manual of
   Style.
1. Submit by opening a pull request to
   [the upstream *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push).
1. Make adjustments to your article as warranted by the open review (your pull request will
   automatically update as you push your changes to GitHub).

See the [setup instructions](/setup.html) and [style guide](/style-guide.html) for additional
information and guidance. And if you need a question answered, just
[open an Issue on the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new).
