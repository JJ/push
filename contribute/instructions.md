## How to write and submit an article for *Push*

**In a nutshell**: Fork the Push repository on GitHub and clone it to your computer. Make a copy of
the article starter file. Fill in your information at the top of the file, and write up your work in
Markdown. Track your progress with frequent Git commits. Keep your article under 2500 words or so,
cite in APA wherever necessary (other academic publications, technical documentation, etc.), and
submit by opening a pull request to *Push*.
