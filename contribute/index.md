# Contributing to Push

There are many different ways you can contribute to *Push*.

* **Spread the word**: Share the [push.cwcon.org](http://push.cwcon.org/) URL with friends and
  colleagues on email lists & social networks.
  Follow and mention the [*Push* Twitter account, @p117sh](http://twitter.com/p117sh).

* **Sign up for a GitHub account, and watch the Push repository**: Everything
  about *Push*, from submission to open review, happens through [GitHub](http://github.com). [Sign
  up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free), and consider using your name as your
  username. Be sure, too, to fill out your GitHub profile information.

  Once you have an account, be sure to [watch the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push)
  by pushing the Watch button on the repository page.

* **Submit a blog post**: *Push* has a [blog](/blog/). Submissions will be quickly reviewed.
  Initially, the blog will focus on the development of the journal itself.

  Once you’re ready to write a post, [fork the Push repo](https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork),
  [set up Git and GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer, clone your
  fork of the repo, and create a branch called `post` where you’ll write and commit.
  [See the full submission instructions.](/blog/instructions.html).

* **Submit an article**: Read the [call for papers](/cfp.html). It’s the shortest CFP in the world.
  Have an idea that you’d like feedback on before you write?
  [Open a new issue](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new) on GitHub and write `QUERY:`
  at the beginning of the title.

  If you’ve not already done so, [fork the Push repo](https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork),
  set up Git and GitHub on your computer, clone your fork of the repo, and create a branch called
  `submission` where you’ll write and commit.
  [See the full submission instructions.](instructions.html).

* **Submit a fix or new feature for the journal itself**: All of *Push* is open-source. Fork and
  clone the repository, create a feature branch with your fix, and then submit a pull request. Read
  the [setup guide](/setup/) and the [README.md file](https://github.com/cwcon/push#readme),
  which has a To-Do section with a list of things that need doing.

* **Review draft blog posts, article submissions, and journal fixes/features**: Every contribution
  will be handled as a Pull Request or Issue in GitHub; if you
  [sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and
  [watch the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push)
  by pushing the Watch button on the repository page, you will receive email notifications of
  the journal’s activity (pro tip: use an email client like GMail that enables filtering, so
  that your inbox doesn’t get cluttered up with GitHub notifications).
