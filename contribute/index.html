    <p>If your writing or your students’ writing happens in plain text and there’s some computer language involved, whether its for markup, design, or full-on scripting and programming, <em>Push</em> wants to help you develop and publish an openly reviewed article about it. Whether you’ve gained some insights from your very first time teaching HTML, or you have a radically new perspective for approaching a writing task with the assistance of an entire language or framework, submit your article on the matter to <em>Push</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself before you submit (and even before you start to draft):</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How deeply does this matter to you?</strong> Be passionate about your argument. <em>Push</em> isn’t for publishing comfortable, arm-chair critical perspectives. Believe in what you’re writing. Be willing to fight to defend your perspective. Compell your audience to act on what you say.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>How will this make the world better?</strong> <em>Push</em> is a venue for applied research into source-level digital writing, research that’s meant to do more than show everyone how smart you are. Your submission can be as theoretically rich as you’d like, but it must do something to make the world better for writers and the teaching of writing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Does this reflect best practices?</strong> It’s one thing to write with source code in a slipshod way that gets the job done. It’s another to highlight the intensive research component of writing source code that reflects best practices. “Best practices” are always moving targets, but strive to include the best known practices, especially practices you’ve discovered, in your submission.</p>
