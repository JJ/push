Here are some questions to ask yourself before you submit (and even before you start to draft):

1. **How deeply does this matter to you?** Be passionate about your argument. *Push* isn’t for
publishing comfortable, arm-chair critical perspectives. Believe in what you’re writing. Be willing
to fight to defend your perspective. Compell your audience to act on what you say.

2. **How will this make the world better?** *Push* is a venue for applied research into source-level
digital writing, research that’s meant to do more than show everyone how smart you are. Your
submission can be as theoretically rich as you’d like, but it must do something to make the world
better for writers and the teaching of writing.

3. **Does this reflect best practices?** It’s one thing to write with source code in a slipshod way
that gets the job done. It’s another to highlight the intensive research component of writing source
code that reflects best practices. “Best practices” are always moving targets, but strive to include
the best known practices, especially practices you’ve discovered, in your submission.
