# Setup

*Push* is based on a whole stack of technologies that, while powerful, are not all that common on
most digital writers’ computers. *Push* is meant to be a learning experience for all who work on it,
and the learning starts here.

Each step (minus Step 0) includes a captioned screencast as well as step-by-step instructions.
You might want to watch the screencast first; most tasks are a lot less complex and cumbersome than
the written instructions suggest.

## The Basics

  Contribute to *Push* in nine steps (not including computer prep[^prepnote]):

* ### [Step 0: Computer Preparation](/setup/computer-preparation.html)

  You’ll probably need to set up some technologies on the Web and on your computer. Don’t worry;
  they’re all free and open-source.

* ### [Step 1: Get a Copy of *Push*](/setup/fork-and-clone.html)

  In order to work on Push, you need to get yourself a copy. It’s easier than you’d think.

* ### [Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace](/setup/branching.html)

  Where you do your work to contribute to *Push* matters. Just a few steps, and you’ll be ready to
  get writing.

* ### [Step 4: Write in YAML and Markdown](/setup/yaml-and-markdown.html)

  To contribute articles and blog posts to *Push*, you’ll write in two different formats that will
  probably seem instantly familiar, YAML and Markdown.

* ### [Step 5: Preview Changes as You Work](/setup/previewing-work.html)

  Your copy of *Push* comes ready-made to work on a tiny Web server that runs on your computer.
  See changes instantly as you make them, exactly as they’d appear on the actual *Push* site.
  Now that’s some WYSIWYG.

* ### [Step 6: Mark Major Milestones](/setup/add-and-commit.html)

  Git’s not a technology for around passing files & changes. It’s a revision-oriented writer’s
  dream.

* ### [Step 7: Backup and Share](/setup/git-push.html)

  Don’t just keep your work on a single computer. Pushing work back to GitHub gives you a backup,
  and enables you to work across different computers.

* ### [Step 8: Submit](/setup/pull-requests.html)

  Ready to submit your contribution to *Push*? It takes only seconds.

* ### [Step 9: Revise](/setup/revise-and-push.html)

  Submit, get feedback. Then start revising.

## Some Advanced Topics

The basics above are all you need to successfully contribute to *Push*. But if you want to dig
deeper and impress your friends, dive into some of these advanced topics.

* ### [Change File Names in Git](/setup/change-file-names.html)

  Did you change your article or blog post title after you started writing? Do you want to
  update the date on your blog post files? There’s a special way to do that in Git.

* ### [Keep Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/setup/stay-updated.html)

  Once you make a copy of *Push*, you have to keep it up to date. And you’ll want to start
  new submissions based on the most up-to-date version of *Push*.

* ### [Pretend You Kept Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/setup/git-rebase.html)

  Work on *Push* is distributed and ongoing. Make your contribution appear to be based on
  the very latest version of *Push*.

* ### [Fix Common Git Goofs](/setup/fixing-git-goofs.html)

  Added a file that’s not ready to be committed? Committed a file that you shouldn’t have?
  Want to just start over from an earlier point in your work’s history? No problem.

* ### [Submit as One Commit](/setup/squashing-commits.html)

  Keep reviewer’s lives easier. Let Git help you submit a single, seamless commit containing your
  changes.

* ### [Collaborate with Others](/setup/multiple-remotes.html)

  Sometimes a comment on GitHub isn’t enough. Sometimes you want to write an article
  collaboratively. Learn how to collaborate like a pro.
