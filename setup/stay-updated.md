# Keep Your Copy of *Push* Updated

Forking on GitHub couldn’t be easier--but the problem with forking is that the instant you fork,

made by other contributors has to be handled manually. Fortunately, Git has methods built right in
that make staying in sync an easy proposition.

commit to master, or merge your commits into it.
