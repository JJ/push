## Previewing Push on Your Computer

*Push*â€™s reliance on Jekyll makes it ready-made to preview on a real, live web server running right
on your computer. All you have to do is run

    $ ./serve.sh

on your command line from within the `/push` directory.

Open your web browser of choice, and point it to `http://localhost:4000/` You should see *Push* in
your browser, just like the one at `http://push.cwcon.org/`.

As you make changes, the HTML will be automatically regenerated, so you can preview your work right
in the browser. Nifty.
