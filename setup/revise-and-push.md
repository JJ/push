## Step-by-Step Instructions

### On Your Computer
*You’ll do this each time you make revisions to your work.*

## Next Steps

You’ve now covered all of the essential steps for making contributions to *Push*. Here are some
additional, advanced topics that you can learn to impress your friends (or at least to solve some
problems that sometimes creep up when using Git):

* **[Change File Names in Git](/setup/change-file-names.html)**: Did you change your article or blog
  post title after you started writing? Do you want to update the date on your blog post files?
  There’s a special way to do that in Git.

* **[Keep Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/setup/stay-updated.html)**: Once you make a copy of *Push*,
  you have to keep it up to date. And you’ll want to start new submissions based on the most
  up-to-date version of *Push*.

* **[Pretend You Kept Your Copy of *Push* Updated](/setup/git-rebase.html)**: Work on *Push* is
  distributed and ongoing. Make your contribution appear to be based on the very latest version of
  *Push*.

* **[Fix Common Git Goofs](/setup/fixing-git-goofs.html)**: Added a file that’s not ready to be
  committed? Committed a file that you shouldn’t have? Want to just start over from an earlier point
  in your work’s history? No problem.

* **[Submit as One Commit](/setup/squashing-commits.html)**: Keep reviewers’ lives easier. Let Git
  help you submit a single, seamless commit containing your changes.

* **[Collaborate with Others](/setup/multiple-remotes.html)**: Sometimes a comment on GitHub isn’t
  enough. Sometimes you want to write an article collaboratively. Learn how to collaborate like a
  pro.
