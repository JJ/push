## How to write and submit

**In a nutshell**: Fork the Push repository on GitHub, clone it to your computer, and make a copy of
the article starter file. Fill in your information at the top of the file, and write up your work in
Markdown. Track your progress with frequent Git commits. Keep your article under 2500 words or so,
cite in APA wherever necessary (other academic publications, technical documentation, etc.), and
submit by opening a pull request to *Push*.

## Radically Open

*Push* aims to set a new standard for openness.

* **Open Access**: *Push*’s content is freely available and liberally licensed. That’s nothing new
in the world of open access publishing. But by hosting
[all of *Push*’s source code](https://github.com/cwcon/push/) on GitHub, there are no secrets,
nothing that isn’t subject to public scrutiny and review–and improvement. Comment on
[commits](https://github.com/cwcon/push/commits/master/).
[Open a new issue](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues) to spark discussion.
[Fork the codebase](https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork), and then
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/cwcon/push/pulls) with your contribution for discussion,
refinement, and ultimately inclusion in the journal’s codebase.

* **Open Review**: For publications that want to be medieval, gate-keeping organizations and nothing
more, double-blind peer review (usually by only a couple of people, chosen at the whim of an editor)
will suffice, particularly in established areas of inquiry. But *Push* is not just some gate-keeper;
its purpose isn’t to block ideas so much as to help develop ideas and researchers working in a very
new area of inquiry, with few established experts.

* **Open Communication**: *Push* will not use any communication channels that are not publically
available and open. No secret communiques. No backchannel. All communication regarding the journal’s
development, the review of blog posts and articles, and changes to the fundamental structure of
the journal itself will take place on GitHub.
