# Introducing Push

*Push* is a new journal whose sole focus is on publishing original research on writing with source
code.

## Mission

*Push*’s mission is:

* **to help develop writers and researchers working with source code**, both through the published
  [issues](/issues/) of the journal and the active, open process by which submissions are reviewed
  and improved on the road to publication;
* **to advocate for individuals working to incorporate source-level writing** into their research,
  classrooms, and professional development;
* and most of all, **to improve the sophistication of digital writers** writing in a
  software-neutral, source-level way.

## A Different Technological Approach

And because of its mission and focus, the journal itself and the means by which people
[contribute](/contribute/) to it are based in technologies of source-level writing, in a
radically open way. The entirety of *Push*, including its core scripts and templates as well as
(eventually) its submissions and published issues, is openly available as a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push). There are no secrets here, and everything is
open for review and improvement.

And in radical contrast to the heavy, database-driven systems behind so many websites, including
digital journals, *Push* is just a humble collection of HTML pages compiled from source before being
pushed out to GitHub as the pages you’re looking at here.

## Help Wanted: Yours

So, let’s get started. Learn a bit more [about](/about/) the journal. Check out the initial
[blog posts](/blog/) on the genesis and development of *Push*. And then read about how you can
[contribute](/contribute/) to *Push*, and help build a journal that will push the practice of
digital writing more radically forward.
