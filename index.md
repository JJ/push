## Radically Open

*Push* aims to set a new standard for openness.

* **Open Access**: *Push*’s content is freely available and liberally licensed. That’s nothing new
  in the world of open access publishing.

  But by hosting [all of *Push*’s source code](https://github.com/cwcon/push/) on GitHub, there are
  no secrets, nothing that isn’t subject to public scrutiny and review–and improvement. Comment on
  [commits](https://github.com/cwcon/push/commits/master/).
  [Open a new issue](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues) to spark discussion.
  [Fork the codebase](https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork), and then
  [submit a pull request](https://github.com/cwcon/push/pulls) with your contribution for
  discussion, refinement, and ultimately inclusion in the journal’s codebase.

* **Open Review**: For publications in established areas of inquiry that serve as gate-keeping
  organizations, double-blind peer review (usually by only a couple of people, at the discretion of
  an editor) will suffice. But *Push* is not just some gate-keeper; its purpose isn’t simply to
  block research. All who wish to [contribute](/contribute/) to *Push* should be as invested in
  producing a quality publication with quality articles as much as they are invested in helping
  develop researchers who submit their work.

  Research into source code as part of the written rhetorical act represents a very new area of
  inquiry, with few established experts. *Push* aims to identify and develop those experts through a
  scholarly venue dedicated to writing & source.

* **Open, Distributed Archiving**: To submit or otherwise contribute to *Push*, you have to
  [fork its repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push/fork), and then pull down your forked copy
  to your own computer. Each time you do that, you make a complete copy of the journal. You
  particpate in its archiving as well as its improvement.

* **Open Communication**: *Push* will not use any communication channels that are not publically
  available and open. No secret communiques. No backchannel. All communication regarding the
  journal’s development, the review of blog posts and articles, and changes to the fundamental
  structure of the journal itself will take place on GitHub.
