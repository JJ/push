# 404: Page Not Found

Well something got screwed up somewhere.

We aggressively check *Push* for bad links, so odds are you arrived here from a Tweet or an email
link or someone elseâ€™s site. Few things have moved around, but the items that have are:

* The old setup page is now [Push Learn](/learn/)
* The [Push Style Guide](/learn/style-guide.html) has a new home, under Push Learn
* The [brief blog and article submission instructions](/learn/quick-instructions.html) have also
  moved

If you suspect something more sinister is going on, please [open an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new) and tell us what page you were on when you clicked
& wound up on this unfortunate 404 page.
