# How to write and submit a post to Push Blog

(Initially, the blog will focus on opening up the process and editorial and design decisions behind
*Push*, as well as highlighting contributions and contributors to the journalâ€™s core files and
scripts.)

1. Fork [the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push) on GitHub and clone
   it to your computer. Create a new branch called `post`.
1. Make a copy of the post starter file, `_starter.md` in the `_posts` directory, and name it
  `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md` (with the date and actual post title, of course).
1. Fill in the information at the top of the file, and write up your post in Markdown.
1. Track your progress with frequent Git commits.
1. Push your work to your fork at GitHub.
1. Submit by opening a pull request to
   [the upstream *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push).
1. Make adjustments to your post, if necessary, and push to GitHub (your pull request will
   automatically update after you push your changes).

See the [setup instructions](/setup.html) and [style guide](/style-guide.html) for additional
information and guidance. And if you need a question answered, just
[open an Issue on the *Push* repository](https://github.com/cwcon/push/issues/new).
